This folder contains example R code pipeline showing how the Shorebird Collective cleans and harmonizes shorebird tracking datasets. This code is referenced in a preprint of a paper describing our work and is currently available here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.30.576574v3

The code was built using R Version 4.4.0 and following the Movebank Attribute Dictionary (https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-content/movebank-attribute-dictionary) as of 2024-06-01. 

Sensitive information and study-specific filtering steps are not included in this example for privacy reasons. Some examples include single tags deployed on multiple birds but not separated in Movebank, tags tested prior or after deployment on a bird, data stored in the same Movebank study with different ownership and terms of use, etc. 

Please cite our paper and this Github Repository if you use this code for your work.
