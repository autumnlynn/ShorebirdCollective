# ShorebirdCollective

Welcome to GitHub repository of the [Shorebird Science and Conservation Collective](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/migratory-birds/shorebird-collective) ("The Shorebird Collective"). This is where we share example R code pipelines and form templates used by the Collective to facilitate the sharing and analysis of shorebird movement data for conservation. We hope groups with similar aims can use these examples. This is a work in progress.
